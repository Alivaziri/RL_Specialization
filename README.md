# ReinforcementLearning_Specialization
The Reinforcement Learning Specialization consists of 4 courses exploring the power of adaptive learning systems and artificial intelligence (AI). In this specialization, learners were taught to: Build a Reinforcement Learning system for sequential decision-making; understand the space of Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Temporal- Difference learning, Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Q-learning, Policy Gradients, Dyna, and more); understand how to formalize a task as a Reinforcement Learning problem, and how to begin implementing a solution; understand how RL fits under the broader umbrella of machine learning.
